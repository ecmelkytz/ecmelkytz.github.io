While doing research to find the RGB equivalent of a color I saw on the screen, I came across a terminal application called **grabc**.

I can say that it will be very convenient, especially for front-end developers.

### Setup

```bash
sudo apt-get install grabc
```

### Usage

When you type **grabc** into the terminal, the cursor will look like a '+' shape and the hex and RGB code of the color of the place that you clicked will be printed on the screen.

```bash
$ grabc

#f55567
245,85,103
```
